# How to Add Your Design Work to the Portfolio

## 📁 Step 1: Create Portfolio Folder
Create this folder structure in your project:
```
public/
  images/
    portfolio/
      website-banner-1.jpg
      social-media-post-1.jpg
      ads-branding-1.jpg
```

## 🖼️ Step 2: Add Your Images
Place your design files in `public/images/portfolio/` with these exact names:

### Website Banner
- **File**: `website-banner-1.jpg`
- **Type**: Your best website banner/hero design
- **Size**: Recommended 1200x600px or similar banner ratio

### Social Media Post
- **File**: `social-media-post-1.jpg` 
- **Type**: Instagram/Facebook post design
- **Size**: Square format (1080x1080px) works best

### Ads & Branding
- **File**: `ads-branding-1.jpg`
- **Type**: Advertisement or branding work
- **Size**: Any professional design format

## ✏️ Step 3: Update Project Details (Optional)
In `src/pages/GraphicDesign.jsx`, you can customize:
- **title**: Change project names to match your work
- **description**: Update to describe your specific projects

Example:
```javascript
{
  title: "Your Actual Project Name",
  description: "Description of your real project and results"
}
```
